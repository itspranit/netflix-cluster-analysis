# Netflix Clustering Project

## Overview
This project performs unsupervised clustering analysis on a Netflix dataset using K-Means clustering. The goal is to identify distinct clusters based on genres and other attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)  
*Note: Due to licensing, the raw dataset is not included here. Please download it from Kaggle.*

## Analysis Steps
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and encoding
- Elbow method used to determine the optimal number of clusters
- K-Means clustering applied to segment shows/movies
- Visualizations include elbow plot, cluster-wise genre distribution, and PCA scatter plots
